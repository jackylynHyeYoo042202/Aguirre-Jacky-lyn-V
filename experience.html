                The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) - Sorsogon Provincial Office plays a vital role in promoting digital transformation, innovation, and public service within the province. 
                As an intern from January to May 2025, I was given the opportunity to be part of various technical, administrative, and outreach initiatives aimed at strengthening digital literacy and government service delivery. 
                Through the guidance of my mentors and the support of the DICT team, I was able to deepen my skills in programming, networking, system testing, robotics, documentation, and public speaking. 
                This experience not only enhanced my technical capabilities but also taught me the importance of professionalism, teamwork, and continuous learning in a real-world environment. 
                I am truly grateful for the chance to contribute to the organization's mission and to grow both personally and professionally during my time at DICT Sorsogon.
